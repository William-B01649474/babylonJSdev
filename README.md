# BabylonJS Project: Five Scenes of Basic Functions

Welcome to the **My First JavaScript Project**, where we explore five unique scenes showcasing the core features and functionalities of the BabylonJS library. Each scene demonstrates different concepts like lighting, animation, GUI integration, and interactions, providing a foundation for learning 3D web development.

## Overview
This project is built using **BabylonJS**, a powerful WebGL-based 3D engine. It includes five distinct scenes:

1. **Scene 1**: Sphere animation on a simple scene.
2. **Scene 2**: Basic 3D Environment and Camera Constrains.
3. **Scene 3**: User Interaction with Camera Movements.
4. **Scene 4**: Interactive GUI with Button Actions.
5. **Scene 5**: GUI Elements and Transitions.

Each scene demonstrates practical use-cases of BabylonJS, making it an excellent resource for beginners and enthusiasts alike.

## Features
- **Interactive Scenes**: Explore GUI, animations, and interactive camera controls.
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Experience different types of lights, including hemispheric and spotlight.
- **Texturing**: Learn how to apply materials and textures to objects.
- **User Input**: Handle key presses and mouse movements to interact with scenes.
- **Optimized Performance**: Efficiently designed for web browsers.
